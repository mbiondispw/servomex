# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate label and state filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside the clone.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The map is a single issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog.
- **Child ticket**: a GitHub sub-issue, or a task-list fallback, labelled `wayfinder:<type>`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies, with a `Blocked by:` fallback.
- **Frontier query**: choose the first open, unblocked, unassigned child in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me`.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the child, and add its context pointer to the map.
